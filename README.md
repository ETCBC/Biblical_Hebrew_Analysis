Welcome to the website of Gino Kalkman! The website consists of a collection of Notebooks in which we present our translations and analyses of the 150 Psalms in the Hebrew Bible and our theory on the use of the verbal forms in Biblical Hebrew poetry. The website is complementary to the dissertation 'Verbal Forms in Biblical Hebrew Poetry: Poetical Freedom or Linguistic System?' (forthcoming).

Currently, the ETCBC-database is made available in [LAF](http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=37326). It is also possible to obtain the data from this resource. A first experiment in using [LAF-fabric](http://laf-fabric.readthedocs.org/) for our type of research can be found
