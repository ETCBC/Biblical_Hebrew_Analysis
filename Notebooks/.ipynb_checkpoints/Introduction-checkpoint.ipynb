Since our research focuses on patterns of verbal forms, we are most interested in the type of analysis that has been done (by ourselves) at the highest level, namely that of creating a syntactic hierarchy of the text, in which all clause atoms are given a place. This hierarchy enables us to identify the pairs of mother and daughter clauses that eventually have been assembled in our <a href=\"ConcordanceOfPatterns.ipynb\" target=\"_blank\">Concordance of Patterns</a>.

      "<p>The results of the calculations made by our programme are presented in the notebook's second section. This section contains a table in which each clause (or clause atom, namely if a clause is splitted into different parts because of embedded elements) is dealt with in a separate row. Let us briefly go through the columns of which the table shown in this section is made up.</p>\n",
      "<p>In the first two columns, we give the numbers of the verse and the (sub) paragraph to which a clause (atom) belongs. The paragraph numbers are based on the instructions provided during the creation of the syntactic hierarchy of the Psalm and usually mark continuation within or transitions between textual domains.</p>\n",
      "<p>The next column contains the Hebrew text of the clause (atom). If one places the cursor on the Hebrew text, the translation made of that text by our Java program shows up below the Hebrew text. This will prevent one from having to switch back and forth between section 1 and section 2. Again, information on the labels identifying the clause atom relations and the functions of the constituent phrases can be found in the \"HebrewText\" notebook, which is linked to in the 'Hebrew text' heading, while the creation of our translation is explained in the <a href=\"Translation.ipynb\" target=\"_blank\">'Translation' notebook</a>.</p>\n",
      "<p>The fourth column informs us about the type of the clause. More information about the clause-type labels that have been used can be obtained by clicking on the link in the heading of the column. If one hovers over the clause type labels, information pops up about the default discourse functions executed by the respective clauses. In addition, this information box also identifies mainline markers, if these are present in the clause. Since the default discourse functions are inextricably bound to the type of the verbal predicate in the clause, we deemed it sufficient to present them in this way instead of always showing them explicitly in separate columns. Information about the default discourse functions and the effect of mainline markers can be found in the <a href=\"DefaultDiscourseFunctions.ipynb\" target=\"_blank\">notebook on default discourse functions</a>.</p>\n",
      "<p>The next columns provide insights into a clause's function in terms of volitivity, non-volitivity and indicativity. First, we provide the default function of a clause. Then there is a column which alarms us in case interesting processes are taking place that affect the (non-)volitive function of a clause. Information about such a process is obtained by hovering the mouse over the exclamation mark.<br>\n",
      "We find such an exclamation mark in Ps 2 : 2. When placing our cursor on the sign, a message pops up telling us that <q>this verb-initial <em>yiqtol</em> clause inherits the multiple-duty modifier <span class = \"hebrew\">&#1500;&#1502;&#1492;</span> and so does not fulfill its volitive default function.</q> In the translation offered in the previous section, we already saw, indeed, that the <em>yiqtol</em> clause in this verse was translated as a <strong>non-volitive</strong> interrogative clause.<br>\n",
      "The final (non-)volitive function of a clause, whether being the result of activated mechanisms of inheritance and blocking or not, is presented in the next column.<br>\n",
      "More information about all this can be found in the notebooks that can be navigated to by clicking on the links in the headings of the respective columns.</p>\n",
      "<p>In the next column we identify socalled '<em>multiple-duty modifiers (MDM)</em>' - clause opening constituents that do not only govern the clause in which they stand, but also one or <em>multiple</em> coordinate daughter clauses. More information about 'multiple-duty modifiers' can, again, be acquired by clicking on the link in the column heading. It should be noted that the inheritance of such governing elements (e.g.: <span class = \"hebrew\">&#1500;&#1502;&#1492;</span>) by daughter clauses is also reflected in the automatically generated translation.</p>\n",
      "<p>Subsequently, we provide information about clause constituent relations (CCR). This enables us to identify (1) clause atoms that form part of a larger clause and, in that clause, fulfill the role of subject, object, or any other constituent, and (2) clauses that together constitute a single sentence. As can be seen in the example, coordinated clauses, which belong to the same sentence as their mother clause, are also identified in this column. More information about clause constituent relations is found in the notebook linked to in the 'CCR' column heading.</p>\n",
      "<p>After this, the final discourse function of a clause (atom) is described. This function is a concretization of the default discourse functional values that were identified in the messages popping up in the 'ClTp' column. The exact determination of the final discourse function and the different descriptive labels used in this column are further explained in the notebook that can be visited by clicking on the link in the 'DiscFunction' column heading.</p>\n",
      "<p>The final column contains a number identifying the type of clause pattern to which the current clause (atom) belongs. Note that for each clause pattern in a Psalm the corresponding number is presented in the row of the daughter clause (atom). The meaning of the different components of the label is elucidated in the 'Concordance of Patterns' that can be navigated to via the link in the final column's heading. By clicking on a pattern number, one will be brought to the corresponding section in the 'Concordance of Patterns', which makes it possible to find out how often the given pattern occurs in the Psalms and in which Psalms other occurrences of the same pattern can be found. An overview of all patterns attested in a Psalm is provided in the third section of a Psalm's notebook.</p>"

By clicking on this pattern number, one is brought to the corresponding section in the Concordance, where other occurrences of the same pattern can be found and looked up.</p>\n",

This will enable the user to get an idea of the broader context in which the given pattern is embedded.</p>\n",

      "<p>The sixth column informs us about clause constituent relations attested in the patterns.

      "<p>The next column shows us which modifiers and multiple-duty modifiers are (assumed to be) present in the clauses making up a clause pattern. Modifiers and multiple-duty modifiers are separated from each other by the fact that the second category is printed between parentheses. Thus, in the sample pattern the mother clause contains the <strong>modifier</strong> <span class = \"hebrew\">&#1500;&#1502;&#1492;</span>, which is subsequently imported as a <strong>multiple-duty modifier</strong> in the daughter clause.

It should be noted that since this information is pattern-specific, it is only included in the daughter clause's row of observations. For every pattern consisting of two non-dependent clauses information is provided about the relation between the subjects of the two clauses. Thus, our sample pattern involves a change of subject (<strong>DS</strong>). For some patterns, additional calculations have been made with regard to the broader set of participants.
