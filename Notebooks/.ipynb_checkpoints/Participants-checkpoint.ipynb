Thus, in patterns consisting of an <em>imperative</em> mother clause and an <em>X-yiqtol</em> daughter clause, inheritance of volitive meaning was only prevented from taking place if the daughter clause introduced a new animate participant as its subject. For these and similar cases, we have used the following descriptions:</p>\n",

      "<p>Finally, in some patterns (syntactic and semantic) parallelism has consequences for the discourse functions adopted by the respective clauses. In such cases, parallelism has been detected and noted down among the observations with regard to the set of participants, since such parallel clauses usually imply a high degree of continuation at the participant level.</p>"
